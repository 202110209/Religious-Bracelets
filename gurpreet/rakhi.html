        <p>Rakhi bracelets, also known as "Raksha Bandhan" bracelets, are a symbol of love and protection in Indian culture. They are traditionally exchanged between brothers and sisters during the festival of Raksha Bandhan, which celebrates the bond between siblings.

            The bracelet, often made of colorful threads and embellished with beads or other decorations, is tied by the sister on her brother's wrist as a symbol of her love and prayers for his well-being. In return, the brother vows to protect and support his sister throughout her life.

            Rakhi bracelets carry deep emotional significance and are a beautiful expression of the special bond shared between siblings. They serve as a reminder of the love, care, and protection that siblings offer each other, making them a cherished tradition in Indian culture.</p>
